# Exercise 04 - removeFromArray

Implement a function that takes an array and some other arguments then removes the other arguments from that array:

```javascript
remove([1,2,3,4], 3) // should remove 3 and return [1,2,4]
```



## hints
the first test on this one is fairly easy, but there are a few things to think about(or google) here for the later tests:
- how to remove a single element from an array
- how to deal with multiple optional arguments in a javascript function
  - [Check this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments).  Scroll down to the bit about `Array.from` or the spread operator.
