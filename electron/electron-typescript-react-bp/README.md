# Electron Boilerplate 🔌

🏗 Boilerplate for [`electron`](https://electronjs.org/) with [`react`](https://reactjs.org/), [`typescript`](http://typescriptlang.org/) and [`less`](http://lesscss.org/).

🔥 The configs are kept as short and minimalistic as possible. Supports client (React) hot reload.

## Quickstart 💥

```
npm i

npm run watch
```
