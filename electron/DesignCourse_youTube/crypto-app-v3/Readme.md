# Crypto Compare

## Building a simple BTC price grabber with Electron + Typescript + React + Webpack: v3

This version extends from the previous one and use another API call to get a full object and not just price. This is used to build up the screen with multiple components with pure CSS. It also does price ticking color changes.

**Running**

1. In the terminal type in *yarn run dev*. This will run the webpack.dev.js file that will compile the typescript to javascript and output to the *dist* folder.
2. In VS Code, click the debug icon in the tool pane on the left, in the dropdown at the top, select *Electron: All*
3. Hit F5 and it will launch the electron window and [grab some crypto coins back](https://www.cryptocompare.com/)
