First shot at creating a project with several technologies:

1. Typescript
2. React
3. Webpack
4. Electron
5. Babel

There was lots of Googling and following multiple guides just to get the project set up.

## Typescript + React
Followed the [starter guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter) to get the TS + R boilerplate going as recommended by the TS folks

## Typescript + React + Webpack
There were a couple of other guides that gave better explanations when throwing babel & electron to the mix
[1](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/06/06/typescript-electron-webpack.html)
[2](https://taraksharma.com/setting-up-electron-typescript-react-webpack/) - ended up using this person's webpack configs 


## Babel
Depends on how you setup webpack (what a trip), you [may not need the babel loader](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49081883/do-i-need-babel-loader-on-top-of-tsloader-to-transpile-typescript-with-webpack)
